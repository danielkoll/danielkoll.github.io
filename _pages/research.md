Welcome! I'm an assistant professor in Peking University's [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://atmos.pku.edu.cn) and a member of our [Planetary Atmospheres](https://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/en/research/Researchdirections/144785.htm) group.

I originally grew up in Tanzania, Germany, and Kenya. I went on to study Physics and Philosophy at Harvard, and did a PhD in climate science and extrasolar planets at the University of Chicago. After that I was a postdoc at MIT, supported by a fellowship from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. I now work at Peking University in Beijing, China.

Why do different planets have such different climates? My work tries to explore this question from a range of angles, with a particular emphasis on the atmospheres of exoplanets and climate change on Earth. Find out more by checking out my recent [publications](https://danielkoll.github.io/publications).
