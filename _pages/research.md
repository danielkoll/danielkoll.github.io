# Searching for Exoplanets Atmospheres: Theory and Observations

How can we use thermal observations to characterize rocky exoplanets? This area has been a long-standing research focus of mine. I originally started studying exoplanet thermal phase curves during my PhD, largely because they offer a way to probe the atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets (see below). Along the way, however, we discovered that thermal observations of hot rocky exoplanets offer an extremely efficient way to search exoplanets for atmospehres.  


# Atmospheric Dynamics of Tidally-locked Exoplanets

Most exoplanets on short-period orbits are believed to be tidally locked, but how does this affect their atmospheric dynamics? Our Solar System has no planets that are tidally locked to the Sun, but tidal models have long suggested that many exoplanets should be tidally locked to their host stars.


# Spectral Foundations of Earth's Climate

What do other planets tell us about our own planet's climate? It turns out, quite a lot! During my postdoc we started investigating how the runaway greenhouse limit influences a planet's radiation balance, and we ended explaining a fundamental property of Earth's climate [(Koll & Cronin 2019)](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/09/24/1809868115).
