Welcome! I'm an assistant professor in Peking University's [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://atmos.pku.edu.cn) and a member of our [Planetary Atmospheres](https://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/en/research/Researchdirections/144785.htm) group.

I originally grew up in Tanzania, Germany, and Kenya. I went on to study Physics and Philosophy at Harvard, and did a PhD in climate science and extrasolar planets at the University of Chicago. After that I was a postdoc at MIT, supported by a fellowship from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. I now work at Peking University in Beijing, China.

Why do different planets have such different climates? My work tries to explore this question from a range of angles, with a particular emphasis on the atmospheres of exoplanets and climate change on Earth. Find out more by checking out my recent [publications](https://danielkoll.github.io/publications).

    	Still no atmospheres? ... Qiao Xue and Megan Mansfield led two studies that used JWST to search for signs of atmospheres on the rocky exoplanets <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13340">GJ 1132b</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15123">Gl 486b</a>. The data rule out most atmospheric scenarios, making it unlikely that either planet is holding on to a thick atmosphere.

    	Putting a new spin on the habitable zone ... Our <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad54c1">new study</a>, led by Ruizhi Zhan, investigates the atmospheric dynamics of habitable planets around White Dwarfs. These planets are likely tidally locked but also rotate extremely rapidly, which gives rise to a new regime of atmospheric dynamics we call 'Bat rotation' and which we explain using shallow-water theory. Although it's still unclear whether planets around White Dwarfs are common, our results show that such planets would be extremely attractive targets for atmospheric characterization via JWST thermal phase curves.

    Everybody knows CO2 absorbs radiation, which allows it to act as a radiative forcing. However, Kirchhoff's law states that a gas which absorbs radiation also emits radiation. This means CO2 can influence Earth's radiative feedback. Our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108259">new study</a>, led by Yue Xu, explains why CO2 helps to stabilize Earth's feedback in warm climates, but destabilizes it in cold climates. That means CO2 provides an additional mechanism for feedback state-dependence, which needs to be taken into account when comparing today with paleoclimates or future climates.

    Tidal models long predicted that exoplanets should be tidally locked, but didn't have much empirical evidence to back them up. Our <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2077">new study</a>, led by Xintong Lyu, shows that thermal observations of the super-Earth LHS 3844b strongly constrain its rotation rate; the planet is almost certainly tidally locked. In addition, its surface is almost as dark as a perfect blackbody, so LHS 3844b's surface is likely space weathered.

	Does moisture strengthen or weaken atmospheric eddies? Our new study led by Nick Lutsko suggests that, in an Earth-like atmosphere, moisture makes storms weaker. A preprint is available <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/users/529274/articles/694474-atmospheric-moisture-decreases-mid-latitude-eddy-kinetic-energy">here</a>.

over a first test run with the Spitzer telescope<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1497-4">e</a></sup>,
to now having the incredible capabilities of JWST, the search for atmospheres on roughly Earth-sized planets has been one of the most exciting research areas I've had the privilege to be involved with. In this paper, our team found that the nearby TRAPPIST-1c does not have a thick Venus-like atmosphere. Given the similar finding for the neighboring TRAPPIST-1b<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05951-7">f</a></sup>,
maybe it's harder than we originally thought to find truly Earth-like planets out there?

	The most important feedback for determining how much Earth warms under global warming is the longwave clearsky feedback. Together with Nadir Jeevanjee and Nick Lutsko, we developed a way to estimate this feedback solely using pen and paper. The paper is published
	<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-22-0178.1/JAS-D-22-0178.1.xml">here</a>. Want to compute analytical spectral feedbacks yourself? The scripts are available on <a href="https://github.com/danielkoll/spectral_feedbacks">github</a>.

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

<!-- A data-driven personal website -->
<!-- ====== -->
<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->

<!-- Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->

<!-- Getting started -->
<!-- ====== -->
<!-- 1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!) -->
<!-- 1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.  -->
<!-- 1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL. -->
<!-- 1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct") -->
<!-- 1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.   -->
<!-- 1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->

<!-- Site-wide configuration -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->

<!-- Create content & metadata -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator** -->

<!-- I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator -->
<!-- ) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->

<!-- How to edit your site's GitHub repository -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.  -->

<!-- For more info -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
